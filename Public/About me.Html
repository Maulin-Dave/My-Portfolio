    <h1>About me</h1>
    <p>Hey there, welcome to my portfolio! I'm <b>Maulin Dave</b>, and I've been on an exciting journey as a self-taught programmer diving headfirst into the world of IT. It all started with a curiosity-driven exploration of coding, and since then, I've been hooked on the thrill of creating and problem-solving.</p>

    <p>I've taught myself HTML, JS, CSS, finding joy in unraveling the complexities of software development. What began as a hobby quickly evolved into a passionate pursuit to master the craft and contribute meaningfully to the tech landscape. </p>

    <p>Transitioning into IT was a natural progression for me. I've come to understand that technology isn't just about computers and code, it's about using innovation to solve real-world challenges. Whether it's building robust applications, optimizing systems for efficiency, or ensuring cybersecurity measures are top-notch, I thrive on the diversity and impact of IT.</p>

    <p>This portfolio is a glimpse into my workâ€”a collection of projects that showcase my skills and creativity. I believe in the power of technology to empower individuals and businesses, and I'm passionate about using my skills to make a difference. </p>
